Assignment 4 - Components
===

Due: October 4th, by 11:59 AM.

For this assignment you will re-implement the client side portion of *either* A2 or A3 using either React or Svelte components. If you choose A3 you only need to use components for the data display / updating; you can leave your login UI as is.

[Svelte Tutorial](https://github.com/cs-4241-23/cs-4241-23.github.io/blob/main/using.svelte.md)  
[React Tutorial](https://github.com/cs-4241-23/cs-4241-23.github.io/blob/main/using.react.md)  

This project can be implemented on any hosting service (Glitch, DigitalOcean, Heroku etc.), however, you must include all files in your GitHub repo so that the course staff can view them.

In order for my project to work with React, I had to tear down a lot of the features that were present in my last assignment. These features included google and local authentication for signing in and registering, as well as storing user data in mongodb. The new technology hindered my development due to a number of different bugs that were preventing me from properly communicating with the server. I believe this had to do with the fact that I was trying to use React Router to aid in having multiple pages (login, register, contacts). This is all obviously due to lack of experience and I will be sure to learn from this experience and be more prepared for future assignment.
