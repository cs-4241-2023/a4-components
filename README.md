**WPI Badminton Attendance Tracker**

I created a web app for Badminton Club members who are using their participation in this course as a gym credit to track their progress toward their grade goal. First the user either enters or creates account information, so that they can only see their progress, and login in. The user then enters their target grade and the dates + amount of hours they attended on each day to keep track of the user's progress toward their grading goal. 

The user can also edit their grading goal and delete entries they make. 

The most obvious change compared to A3 and A2 is that this iteration uses Svelte rather than pure HTML and JS. I also reverted back to locally storing in the server rather than using MongoDB (like A2), but kept the accesibility, server, and style benefits from A3.

 Initially, adding the new technology proved to be quite useful, being able to split up the pages with all the JS, HTML, and CSS for certain sections and having it all in one place and being able to edit it all at once proved to be helpful. But I ran into big issues with having those seperate components functioning as one, with still some features from A3 (mainly seperate pages) missing. If I was more farmiliar with Svelte from the begining, I think I would have had A3 structured differently to work better.
