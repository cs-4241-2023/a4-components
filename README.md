I combined my a2 and a3 projects and remade my project
using react. I found this project to be slightly harder then 
the two previous ones, since the new edition of states really
confused me at first. For example I had trouble figuring out how to pass a
function to a child component (for delete) but I found out you can
do it through props. Even with these issues though, I would say that
using react improved my development experience over all. 
At the end of the project I felt I had a better understanding of how
every aspect of my applicaiton connected.

I mostly copied my a2 format, but added in my a3 component of loading
songs when you change the season. I also changed my server to use express like
we did in a3.
