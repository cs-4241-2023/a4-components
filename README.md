I used React to implement the features of A2 in an alternative manner.
Using snowpack as the build tool, I implemented my React code in App.jsx.
Most of the HTML was just copied over from my A2 index.html. Now,
the index.html file serves as a pointer of where to start and
references index.jsx as a script. Some of the functions that were
in the main.js and server.improved.js were also copied into App.jsx
in order to access elements with more ease, such as formatting the
table or strings for prices. A new feature that I was able to implement
with React was a counter. Now, in the Add Item button, there is a counter
that keeps track of how many items a user has put into their shopping list.
This was more difficult to figure out prior to using React. However, it
has proven to be very useful as I was able to simplify how to remove
elements by including a single Remove button, as opposed to before
where I had a button in every row for different elements. React
has also made it much quicker to update the budget and cost labels
especially since these values are updated on a regular basis.
I believe this technology did both improve and hinder the developement
experience. Some syntax that I used in A2, like my old remove button,
was written in a way that was not very conducive for implementing React.
However, once an alternative solution was discovered, the new approach
was actually much easier to understand and more visually appealing.
Although there was certainly a learning curve, these elements can
absolutely be beneficial in development if utilized properly, like
indexing.
