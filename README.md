** For some reason Glitch will fail the get request when the website is first waking up, but after a refresh the website will function normally **

Things added: Error message on login page now displays the error message on the page without needing to create an alert/popup message.

I would say that using React made things more streamlined and easier for me to keep track of how to develop my page. Instead of needing two HTML files that could get confusing to read, I instead had two components and two screens, one for login and the other for the dashboard. I would say the useState and useEffect hooks were the most difficult part to understanding React, but once I understood it made things easier.
