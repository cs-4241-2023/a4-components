## Todo Application

### Changes
I used the React framework to modify my A2 assignment. The web application allows users to add task names, due dates, and priorites for tasks, and the user has the option to complete/delete tasks. However, I combined some requirements from A3 into this project. For A4, my web application has persistent data as required for A3 but has no login or modify functionality. After using React components, I was able to modularize my task entry and task display into two distinct components (look at TaskEntry.jsx for the task entry component and TaskDisplay.jsx for the task display component).

### Thoughts
I believe that React framework really helped with accelerating development of my web application. Breaking up the front-end of the application into multiple components helped me understand and organize my code a lot better: I no longer needed to navigate and edit a single front-end file to build my website. Furthermore, I believe that including HTML with JS can reduce the complexity needed to make dynamic elements on a webpage. With the HTML in the JSX file, I could easily map my data to elements without needed to switch between two files. Overall, React helps break down web applications into their core functionalities which I can reuse and more easily edit.
