## Task Manager

Hosting Link: https://trail-ionian-sleet.glitch.me/

I chose to remake my task manager from assignment 3 using react. I definitely found myself getting through this assignment much faster than A3, partially because of my experience with A3, but also because of my use with react. React allowed me to easily simplify my code as I didn't need as many functions to implement A3's functionality.

This website allows users to connect to a mongodb server and load in data about pending tasks on their todo list. Additionally, it allows you to add, edit, and delete your task data on the server. It will generate a priority depending on how close the task's deadline is to the current day.
