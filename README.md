_This iteration of Plant Watering Tracker is a twist on my a2 version. Instead of calculating the next watering date, it uses filter buttons for the user to display certain plants based on whether or not they have been watered recently._

Meet the <b>Plant Watering Tracker</b>! Input your plant's name and select whether or not it has been watered recently, and the Plant Watering Tracker will save that data and allow you to view what plants have already been watered and which plants still need watering.

Currently, there are 3 starter plants in the dataset. Feel free to add your own plants, edit or delete new or old plants, and check off plants as you water them.

To accomplish this iteration of Plant Watering Tracker, I used React. I found that the learning curve of using React made the implementation of this project more difficult than my first version, hindering the overall development experience. I watched and went through multiple React tutorials (examples: [React Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) and [Getting started with React](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started)) and tried to use various aspects that I learned. Though I did not like trying to use React for this specific project, I do like the concept of React and can see how it would be helpful with future projects. Deploying the React project on Glitch specifically was a challenge as you have to first remix the React project and make sure to follow their specific formatting for the project to work. I also added the sakura CSS class-less framework for the bulk of styling, as I did for a3, but added my own twist by creating and implementing my own color palette.
