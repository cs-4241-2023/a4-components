I choice to reimplement A2 with the addition of the MongoDB using Svelte for this assignment. I had prior experience in Software Engineering with React so I wanted to experiment with a new framework. Using Svelte allowed for less lines of code to accomplish the same tasks and easier rendering of updates to the data. The development process was much easier with Svelte and I found converting everything to Svelte pretty straightforward. Learning how to use Svelte was much simplier for me than first learning React. The small size of this application made Svelte a great choice, but I am interested to see how Svelte would work in a larger scale application.
