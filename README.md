I didn't make any signifigant changes to the site, I just implemented my A2 using React.

The use of new technology started as a hinderance, as I have never used React before and it was weird using JavaScript in this way. However, I understand why developers like this technology and want to use it. With more experience, many of the annoying things to do in base JavaScript become much easier using React, which could make more complicated websites easier to create.
