This project was a revamp of A2 with react components. I Changed the server to work with express and vite express instead of mime, and then all of the frontend code uses react components. The original submit button is created with an onClick call to a submit function which fetches /add in the server code.
This in turn makes a new row in the table with other buttons that both call /change.

Ultimatley, I think the process was very similar to the other projects that we have done. I liked how using npm create-vite made a very clear outline for me so it was easy to get started and change my already existing code from A2.
