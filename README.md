## Contacts Manager

I'm hvaing issues running the server on digital ocean, so would it be possible for this be graded locally? Thanks!

In order for my project to work with React, I had to tear down a lot of the features that were present in my last assignment. These features included google and local authentication for signing in and registering, as well as storing user data in mongodb. The new technology hindered my development due to a number of different bugs that were preventing me from properly communicating with the server. I believe this had to do with the fact that I was trying to use React Router to aid in having multiple pages (login, register, contacts). This is all obviously due to lack of experience and I will be sure to learn from this experience and be more prepared for future assignment.
