## User Database
Glitch Link: [Link](https://a4-alex-marrinan.glitch.me/)

I modified my A2 User DB to allow it to use React, as well as express and mongodb. React was confusing at first since I was turned off by the JavaScript XML inline with normal js code, but overall it was helpful in making certain aspects of the application easier to write. The biggest example is I could refrence variables / functions in the XML directly without having to access the HTML element then assiging it a onclick function.

This page is an application that stores users as well as basic information about them such as their emolyment type, as well as the deperatmant they work in or are majoring in. Uses express, mongodb, and react. You can add new users, defining their properties, and delete preexisting users.
