## MY TODO LIST

I decided to remake my assignment 2 Todo List using React, Express and my CSS framework from assignment 3.

Using React overall improved my development experience as it was easier for me to understand. I was able to condense big portions of my old code into smaller functions in this assignment. The flow of the code just makes a lot more sense than the previous iterations.
