For this assignment you will re-implement the client side portion of *either* A2 or A3 using either React or Svelte components. If you choose A3 you only need to use components for the data display / updating; you can leave your login UI as is.

[Svelte Tutorial](https://github.com/cs-4241-23/cs-4241-23.github.io/blob/main/using.svelte.md)
[React Tutorial](https://github.com/cs-4241-23/cs-4241-23.github.io/blob/main/using.react.md)

This project can be implemented on any hosting service (Glitch, DigitalOcean, Heroku etc.), however, you must include all files in your GitHub repo so that the course staff can view them.
