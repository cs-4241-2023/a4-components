Assignment 4 - Components
===

Due: October 4th, by 11:59 AM.

For this assignment you will re-implement the client side portion of *either* A2 or A3 using either React or Svelte components. If you choose A3 you only need to use components for the data display / updating; you can leave your login UI as is.
