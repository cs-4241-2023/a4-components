## Request for Extension

Hosting link: http://a4-sophia-silkaitis.glitch.me

My project is form for a request for an extension. The user inputs their name, email, assignment, and how many days until it is due. The user then has the option to put a reason for their request. This reason and the days until due go into the derived field of priority- where failure to input a reason or having a due date greater than 10 days puts it as low priority, 5 to 10 days is medium, and <5 days is high priority.
The only thing I changed for this assignent is displaying the data through a table format instead of a list. I thought it made a lot more sense to display it this way and made it overall cleaner.
Overall, I think the technology really helped my development. I like using react, it makes a lot of sense and since it's so popular there are a lot of tutorials if you're stuck. It also was just simpler to figure out. I was a bit confused with the states at first but after watching some tutorials and testing it out I was able to get everything else working on my own relatively quickly. It was a much better A2 experience than earlier in the term.
