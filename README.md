## Overview

The BMI Calculator is a web application designed to help users monitor their Body Mass Index (BMI). It takes into account the user's height, weight, age, and gender to calculate their BMI. Additionally, it keeps track of the user's BMI over time and provides a summary by date when new measurements are added.

## Challenges

During the development of this project, there were some notable challenges:

1. **Transition to React Components**: The main challenge was transitioning to using React components to change the user interface. This shift required getting accustomed to the new technology and its concepts.

2. **Use of MongoDB**: The application utilizes MongoDB to store user data. Notably, the login feature hasn't been implemented in this version (A3).

## Learning Experience

While working on this project, the use of React components proved to be a valuable learning experience. Despite the initial difficulties in navigating this new technology, using components ultimately offers a more efficient way to create new applications.
