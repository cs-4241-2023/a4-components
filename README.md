## Homework Tracker
This is a simple homework tracker, you can enter the class, the assignment details, the due date, and the time it is due, then it calculates home many days until the due date, once you're done with the assignment you can press done (I couldn't get that to work though) and it would remove the assignment, I used css to center all the text and a little bit of padding to space the elements out. I also added a google font

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Create a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. To put it another way, when the user submits data, the server should respond sending back the updated data (including the derived field calculated on the server) and the client should then update its data display.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Testing: 
1. Vieira 
2. The problems she had with my design was that there weren't borders on the table making it a little difficult to see the distinction between columns and to make the font a darker color
3. The comment that surprised me the most was she said that I should prevent the user from backdating and assignment which I didn't really think of as an issue
4. Based on her feedback I would change the table to have borders and I like having the font be white so maybe making a different background color would solve the visibility issue
