I used A2 functionality as a baseline for this assignment. I used the default react styling instead of the styling from a2/a3 due to time constraints. I had to change my original color inputs to regular text inputs, as react doesn't have very good support for color picker inputs by default.

Using react hindered my experience for re-implementing my front-end, as the color inputs were the main component of my application, and I had a lot of trouble trying to get them to work before I decided to just use plain text inputs.
