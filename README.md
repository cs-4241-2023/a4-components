In this assignment i explored how we can use react components to handle the front-end. Here i built different components for different pieces of my app. For instance i built a theme toggler in my app. I used routes to navigate through different pages in my app. I learned how i can serve two different forms both treated as induvidual components, and how we can use states to toggle between the two. Encorporated passport.js to serve as our authentication scheme. built a new taskcard component that allows you to edit in place, and edit multiple tasks all at once. 

This app is fully functioning, and there is undoubtly a lot of other react that is involved. Having a new technology improved certain aspects of the app development allowed for better integration of different technologies, such as icons, better scaling. A major hinderence is the lack of familiarity and the longer development time, this comes from newer technologies being harder to debug while you are learning.
