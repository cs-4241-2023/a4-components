My project is essentially the same as A2 except with different styling, some bug fixes (like the add twice bug), and of course implementing with React. I feel like using React helped me, I was able to find and fix a bug I spent hours on during A2 and wasn't able to get done. With React, I had to be more intentional and organized, therefore it was way more clear where my errors in design were. It felt unnecessary given how small scale my app is but I believe this is a good choice if I was developing something bigger and more intricate because it gives more support for a solid programming foundation.
