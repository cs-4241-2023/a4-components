This project is functionally the same as my a2 project with the ui being slightly improved.

Using react made the development experience a lot easier and cleaner. The syntax felt easier to use and I ran into less errors than I did when first making the project. It took a little bit of time to fully understand react but besides that I felt like it didn't hinder the experience in any way.
