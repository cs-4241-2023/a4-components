 https://a4-adish007.glitch.me/ - glitch project is not working. You may need to do pull request. I used express and vite for my project. 

Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

I added react and changed from my A2. The technology was defeintley harder to learn and made everything a bit difficult. It was interesting to see how different react was. The technology might be useful at a bigger scale but here it felt more like a hassle. 

Unlike previous assignments, this assignment will be solely graded on whether or not you successfully complete it. Partial credit will be generously given.
