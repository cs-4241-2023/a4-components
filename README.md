## WPI School Work Tracker using React.js
For Assignment 4, I chose to implement the web-application that I created for A2/A3 to use
React.js for the front-end. The front-end functionality is now specified
in the `App.jsx` file in the `src` directory. The school work tracker uses MongoDB
to save assignments with the Node.js backend sending the information to React. Overall, 
React made the development process much easier. There was a slight learning
curve initially since I had to learn React's syntax and features. However, once I learned what I 
could do with React, functionality such as `useEffect()` and `useState()` helped tremendously.

## Note to Grader
The free version of Glitch will turn off the server when it has been inactive for longer than five minutes.
There is an issue with Glitch where when it starts the server back up, it will either give the error `Service Unavailable`
or `Cannot GET/`. If this happens for you please reload the page and the app will display correctly. I spoke with Professor
Roberts, and he said that this was okay.
