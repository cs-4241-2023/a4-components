In this project, I re-implemented the client-side portion of my A3 assignment using React.
Using React I completely refactored and redone my client-side code and made it much more compact, efficient, and readable. React allowed me to pass data to and from specific elements on the page very quickly and efficiently.
When it comes to my development experience, it did make it a lot more difficult to initially set up and then test as I initially had to run react and my nodejs server separately until I figured out how to run react from my server. If I had known how to run React from my server code early on, it would have been so much easier and faster to prototype and test different changes as React pushes updates live while I code. Even while I had to run both the React and nodejs separately throughout development, it still felt much easier and more responsive to prototype. I feel like my website is also much faster than my original one which had very inefficient code and because now I update the UI elements at the same time I push data to the server, the UI is a lot snappier and has almost no delay to user input.
