Todo list uses an express server to fetch, add, delete and edit task objects created by the user. Application uses bootstrap to style the UI and uses React to simplify the creation of the task objects and the overall main page. Uses state and effect hooks to store task info and to populate the task table. Using React increased code readability, simplified creation of components in the project, and made updating client-side data easier. I have experience using React so the transition was easy, which improved my development experience.
