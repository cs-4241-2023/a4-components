## TODO 3.0 (React)

https://a4-david-gobran-nja4t.ondigitalocean.app

This is a React implementation of my task tracker from A3. It has a new feature of the 'Create' button changing to 'Modify' and the 'Delete' button appearing when a task is selected. React made it much easier to add this feature, as I used a state to keep track of whether any checkboxes were checked. Conditional rendering, useState, and useEffect altogether made the dev experience much better than vanilla JS. There may be a small bug where you have to click 'Delete' twice for the list to refresh, but the delete is performed on the first click.
