For a4 I decided to redo a2 with React. This is an app to calculate an overall player rating for basketball players. You input the players name, inside shooting score, outside shooting score, athleticism, playmaking, and defense and the overall rating is then calculated. I updated the formatting of the tabs a bit in this assignment. The player name is listed in one row and the number inputs are on the next row.

React definitely improved the development experience for me. I made 4 React components: Add player form, delete player, player table, and tab. This allowed me to put the add and delete components into the tab component, and then display the table below the tabs.
