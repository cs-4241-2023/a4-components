My project allows a user to track their statistics from each Counter-Strike: Global Offensive match. I changed my assignment 2 to use a Vite and Express server with a Svelte frontend. The application looks and behaves exactly the same as my assignment 2, it just runs using different tools and libraries. I believe that the new technology improved the development experience. Using Vite and Express for the server instead of the default HTTP library significantly reduced the length and complexity of my server file. Although there was a learning curve for me in terms of implementing Svelte since I have never used it before, I believe that it also made the code simpler and easier to read in addition to making certain features easier to implement. It also halved the amount of JavaScript code I needed compared to assignment 2.
