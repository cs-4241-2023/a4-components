In this assignment i explored how we can use react components to handle the front-end. Here i built different components for different pieces of my app. For instance i built a theme toggler in my app. I used routes to navigate through different pages in my app. I learned how i can serve two different forms both treated as induvidual components, and how we can use states to toggle between the two. Encorporated passport.js to serve as our authentication scheme. built a new taskcard component that allows you to edit in place, and edit multiple tasks all at once. 

While this app is not fully functioning as you are unable to create persistant tasks, there is undoubtly a lot of other react that is involved. Having a new technology improved certain aspects of the app development allowed for better integration of different technologies, such as icons, better scaling. A major hinderence is the lack of familiarity and the longer development time, this comes from newer technologies being harder to debug while you are learning.
