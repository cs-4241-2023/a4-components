Blogging App

http://a4-randy-huang.glitch.me

This project is an updated version of A2 using React that allows users to create, edit, and delete blog posts. The app uses React for the front-end and Express for the back-end. The app uses a MongoDB database to store blog posts and comments. For this assignment's use case, porting it to use React frustrating since half the code broke and I spent a ton of time debugging, mainly due to ES6 module syntax instead of CommonJS. If there was more development involved or additional features that I would need to add, setting up React for the functionality would be great.
