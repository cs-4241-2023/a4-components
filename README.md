This project is a mockup/beginnings of a website that could be used to manage characters for someone creating a book or a game with history they want to keep track of. It is specifically focused around keeping track of time, and one can create, delete and modify eras on the timeline that appears to the right. Then, any characters they create will be sorted into the eras on the timeline with real time updating.

React definitely was a positive towards development; I specifically like how the HTML blocks could be more easily visualized; without it there was a lot of messy creations using addChild, and randomly inserting HTML elements, their system kept everything in one place. Obviously the conversion was the most difficult part, I think development in react from the beginning would have made this much easier to implement, and would not have been any harder than implementing it normally. One thing that was harder for me was file structure; it took me a long time to determine where files were supposed to go and how I can import one file's contents into another, and even by the end React was still throwing warnings with my solution. Additionally, I feel that the css was clunkier and harder to manage within the React stuff.
